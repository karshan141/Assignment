        <!-- First Question-->
        <section class="question-answer">
            <h3 class="question">01. &nbsp; Why do we start learning a programming language with â€œHello World!"?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"Hello, World!" is a traditional first program that is often used as a simple introductory exercise
                    for learning a new programming language. The reason for using this particular phrase is that it is a
                    simple and well-known message that can be easily understood, even by people who have no prior
                    experience with programming.</p>
                <p>By creating a "Hello, World!" program, students can quickly learn the basic syntax of a new language
                    and get a sense of how code is written and executed. It provides a way to test that the programming
                    environment is set up correctly and that the basic mechanics of compiling and running a program work
                    as expected.</p>
                <p>Overall, "Hello, World!" is an easy and approachable way to introduce learners to a new programming
                    language and help them build a foundation of basic programming concepts.</p>

        <!--Secound Question-->
        <section class="question-answer">
            <h3 class="question">02. &nbsp; How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>In programming, comments are lines of text that are added to the code to provide explanations,
                    documentation, or reminders to the developer who reads the code in the future. Comments are ignored
                    by the computer when the code is executed, and they do not affect the output or behavior of the
                    program.</p>
                <p>In HTML, comments are created using the <b> <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code> </b> tags.
                    Anything
                    written between these tags will be considered as a comment and will not be displayed in the output.

        <!--Third Question-->
        <section class="question-answer">
            <h3 class="question">03. &nbsp; What are elements, tags, and attributs and the differnce between them?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <ol>
                    <li>Elements: An HTML element is a structural component of a webpage, such as a header, paragraph,
                        or image. Each element is identified by an opening tag, which defines the type of element, and a
                        closing tag, which indicates the end of the element's content. For example, the following HTML
                        code creates a paragraph element: <br>
                        <code> &lt;p&gt;  This is a paragraph element. &lt;p&gt;</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Tags: HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of an element. Tags are enclosed in
                        angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag
                        includes the name of the element, and the closing tag includes a forward slash (/) before the
                        element name. Some elements, such as images and line breaks, do not require a closing tag. For
                        example, the following HTML code creates a bold element: <br>
                        <code>&lt;<span>b</span>&gt;This text is bold.&lt;/<span>b</span>&gt;
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Attributes: HTML attributes provide additional information about an element, such as its ID,
                        class, or source URL. Attributes are included within the opening tag and are written in the
                        format name="value". For example, the following HTML code creates an image element with a
                        specified source URL and alt text: <br>
                        <code>&lt;<span >img</span> <span>src</span>="image<span class="hljs-selector-class">.jpg</span>" alt="<span class="hljs-selector-tag">A</span> beautiful sunset"&gt;
                        </code>
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <p>In summary, elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, tags are used to define the structure
                    and content of elements, and attributes provide additional information about elements.</p>
            </div>

        <!--Fourth Question-->
        <section class="question-answer">
            <h3 class="question">04. &nbsp; Briefly explain what HTML entities are.</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent reserved characters or characters
                    that are not part of the standard character set in HTML code. They are represented by a string of
                    characters that starts with an ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) and ends with a semicolon
                    (<code>;</code>).
                </p>
                <p>For example, the less-than sign (<code>&lt;</code>) is a reserved character in HTML code, and if you
                    want to use it as a regular character, you need to represent it using the HTML entity
                    <strong> <u> <code>&amp;lt;</code></u></strong> Similarly, if you want to use non-English characters, like accented letters
                    or special symbols, in your HTML code, you need to use the corresponding HTML entity to represent
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>Using HTML entities helps ensure that your code is valid and that your content is displayed correctly
                    in all browsers and devices, regardless of their character encoding settings.
